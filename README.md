## NEGNN
This repository contains the official implementation of Centrality-based and Similarity-based Neighborhood Extension in Graph Neural Networks.

Parts of the code in this repository have been borrowed from the [Official DGL Examples and Modules](https://github.com/dmlc/dgl/tree/master/examples) PyTorch section and [Link Prediction Tutorial](https://docs.dgl.ai/en/0.8.x/tutorials/blitz/4_link_predict.html). It is recommended to use the `test.py` file to ensure the correctness of evnironment setup. The requirements for running the code are the usual machine learning setting for graphs, inlcluding: `pandas, numpy, matplotlib, networkx, PyTorch, DGL`. To reproduce the experiments, use the run_.py files.

## Credits
