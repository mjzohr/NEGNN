# NEGNN
This repository contains the official implementation of Centrality-based and Similarity-based Neighborhood Extension in Graph Neural Networks.

Parts of the code in this repository have been borrowed from the [Official DGL Examples and Modules](https://github.com/dmlc/dgl/tree/master/examples) PyTorch section. The experiments were conducted using the Google Colab platform. The requirements for running the experiments can be found in the first cells of each IPython Notebook (.ipynb) file. To reproduce the experiments, upload the related (.ipynb) file to colab and run the cells with the corresponding titles.

If you have any questions, encounter bugs, or have suggestions for improvements, please don't hesitate to contact us at (mjzohrabi@aut.ac.ir) or (s.saravani@aut.ac.ir.)
